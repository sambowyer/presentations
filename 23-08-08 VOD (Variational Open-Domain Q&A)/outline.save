intro: ~2 mins 
	motivating ODQA
	w/ v high level overview

	"this paper suggests a new method for ODQA based on Renyi Divergence VI and is evaluated on Q&A datasets, but the authors make the point that the VOD technique could be applied to many other settings (e.g. semantic search in sec 4.6)"

retireval augmented tasks: ~5 mins
	the reader/retriever model (Eq. 1)

	we can do this with VI (using the ELBO) if we define an approx posterior
	...then VI will do x,y,z...

	But the authors suggest that we use Renyi Divergence VI...

Renyi Divergence VI: ~10 mins
	usually use the RVB (Eq. 2) which (like the ELBO) is a lower bound on the marginal log-likelihood
	(and RVB_alpha->1 == ELBO AND RVB_alpha=0 == marge ll)

	In practice, we use an importance weighted version: IW-RVB (Eq. 3)

	and importantly the IW is consistent, so as K->N the IW-RVB -> RVB

	[We can also write the RVB gradient as (Eq. 5)
		this might not be worth including, BUT if I do include it,
			can talk about the joint optimisation of reader & retriever
			+ that nice comment about knowledge distillation
			+ the bits at the start of "Stabilizing training using the RVB"

		... so probably worth including...
	]

VOD objective: ~10 mins
	PROBLEM: size of corpus, N, is v large as hell so IW over all N documents might not be ideal
	SOLUTION: use *priority sampling*

		priority sampling: ~2 mins max.
			basically IW (w/ a uniform proposal?) but only store the top highest-K weights and set the rest equal to the (K-1)-th weight

			nice thing is that (potentially surprisingly) this gives consistent estimators

	... so we can use priority sampling instead of regular IS in the IW-RVB
		and then we reach the VOD objective (Eq. 6)

	[need to think about whether defn of v (Eq. 7) is worth it...
		might be better to just say 
			"v is a priority-sampling approximation of the regular importance weights w"
	]

	NICE FACT: VOD objective and its gradient are consistent
		(i.e. converge to the RVB in the limit K -> N)
		AND can be evaluated w/ complexity O(K)
			(compared to IW-RVB's O(N))
