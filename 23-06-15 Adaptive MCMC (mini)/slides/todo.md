note: consider starting the prez by emphasising how big an area "adaptive MCMC" is, thereby making some attempt at justifying the time taken to make this (and its length)...
    (although of course perhaps brevity was part of the task...)
    (but then again maybe advertising some sort of keenness-to-a-fault isn't such a bad thing...)
    (basically, over-zealousness is better than laziness and/or incompetence, right?)

also probably worth noting that this is trying to be a presentation and set of reference notes at the same time---successfully or not...
