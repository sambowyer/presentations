for ammp_is lrs:
	all_weights is V. SLOW (and not very good)

	bigger lr is better

	ReLU makes regular AMMPIS a bit worse and no_inner_loop a lot better

for rws_lrs:
	regular is best, w/ smaller lrs performing better EVENTUALLY
		but taking longer to get to the better posteriors

	difference isn't all that good, but slight improvement for higher lrs

	standardised isn't v impressive (but better than difference) 
		and fairly invariant to lrs tried

for inner_loop_count:
	(again - ReLU is worse than non-ReLU)
	for sufficiently easy (low enough N or high enough K) posteriors
		not much in it really, so best to do low inner_loop_count
		to save time

	for difficult posteriors, mixed results:
		non-ReLU, sometimes only 1 inner iter is best

		ReLU, sometimes best results w/ max inner iters, 
		      sometimes best results w/ min inner iters	

	in general, however, non-ReLU is better (w/ a single inner iter)
		and ReLU is never really much better, and to achieve
		comparable results, we need HIGH inner iter (which is slow!)

	ACTUAL OBSERVATIONS:
		Often iter_count doesn't make a massive difference

		for low N, non-ReLU wants high iters
		for high N, non-RelU wants low iters

		for most N, ReLU wants high iters

		whether the iters are worth it in terms of time 
			largely depends on K

MAIN RESULTS:
	(need to update these in the morning w/ a closer look)

	regular natural_rws is actually not that bad...?

	but regular ammpis(1) seems to be the best of the ammpises

	
	Q: when is natural_rws better than ammpis(1)? 
		(i.e. w/ K, N, post_width)
	A: When K is low, natural_rws is best, 
		for K == 10:
			low N (50): all amp-is > rws
			N == 500: amp-is(1) ONLY > rws
			N == 5000: rws best
		for K == 30:
			ampis is king (but rws still tends to beat hmc)
		
		AND (i think...) these good ones of ours are all still 
			faster than HMC
	
	amp_is (and rws?) seem to be better in general (compared to hmc)
		 with narrow posteriors
	
	BUT no_inner_loop is only good WITH ReLU, 
		but even with ReLU we get weird results for high N,K
