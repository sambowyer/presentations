	abstract = {Simulators often provide the best description of real-world phenomena. However, they also lead to challenging inverse problems because the density they implicitly define is often intractable. We present a new suite of simulation-based inference techniques that go beyond the traditional Approximate Bayesian Computation approach, which struggles in a high-dimensional setting, and extend methods that use surrogate models based on neural networks. We show that additional information, such as the joint likelihood ratio and the joint score, can often be extracted from simulators and used to augment the training data for these surrogate models. Finally, we demonstrate that these new techniques are more sample efficient and provide higher-fidelity inference than traditional methods.},

Constrained this way, the autoencoder outputs can be interpreted as a set of conditional probabilities, and their product, the full joint probability. We can also train a single network that can decompose the joint probability in multiple different orderings. Our simple framework can be applied to multiple architectures, including deep ones. Vectorized implementations, such as on GPUs, are simple and fast. Experiments demonstrate that this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art tractable distribution estimators.

	abstract = {Many statistical models can be simulated forwards but have intractable likelihoods. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods are used to infer properties of these models from data. Traditionally these methods approximate the posterior over parameters by conditioning on data being inside an \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$-ball around the observed data, which is only correct in the limit \${\textbackslash}epsilon{\textbackslash}!{\textbackslash}rightarrow{\textbackslash}!0\$. Monte Carlo methods can then draw samples from the approximate posterior to approximate predictions or error bars on parameters. These algorithms critically slow down as \${\textbackslash}epsilon{\textbackslash}!{\textbackslash}rightarrow{\textbackslash}!0\$, and in practice draw samples from a broader distribution than the posterior. We propose a new approach to likelihood-free inference based on Bayesian conditional density estimation. Preliminary inferences based on limited simulation data are used to guide later simulations. In some cases, learning an accurate parametric representation of the entire true posterior distribution requires fewer model simulations than Monte Carlo ABC methods need to produce a single sample from an approximate posterior.},

	abstract = {Mechanistic models of single-neuron dynamics have been extensively studied in computational neuroscience. However, identifying which models can quantitatively reproduce empirically measured data has been challenging. We propose to overcome this limitation by using likelihood-free inference approaches (also known as Approximate Bayesian Computation, ABC) to perform full Bayesian inference on single-neuron models. Our approach builds on recent advances in ABC by learning a neural network which maps features of the observed data to the posterior distribution over parameters. We learn a Bayesian mixture-density network approximating the posterior over multiple rounds of adaptively chosen simulations. Furthermore, we propose an efficient approach for handling missing features and parameter settings for which the simulator fails, as well as a strategy for automatically learning relevant features using recurrent neural networks. On synthetic data, our approach efficiently estimates posterior distributions and recovers ground-truth parameters. On in-vitro recordings of membrane voltages, we recover multivariate posteriors over biophysical parameters, which yield model-predicted voltage traces that accurately match empirical data. Our approach will enable neuroscientists to perform Bayesian inference on complex neuron models without having to design model-specific algorithms, closing the gap between mechanistic and statistical approaches to single-neuron modelling.},

	abstract = {In many fields of science, generalized likelihood ratio tests are established tools for statistical inference. At the same time, it has become increasingly common that a simulator (or generative model) is used to describe complex processes that tie parameters \${\textbackslash}theta\$ of an underlying theory and measurement apparatus to high-dimensional observations \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}{\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}p\$. However, simulator often do not provide a way to evaluate the likelihood function for a given observation \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}\$, which motivates a new class of likelihood-free inference algorithms. In this paper, we show that likelihood ratios are invariant under a specific class of dimensionality reduction maps \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}p {\textbackslash}mapsto {\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$. As a direct consequence, we show that discriminative classifiers can be used to approximate the generalized likelihood ratio statistic when only a generative model for the data is available. This leads to a new machine learning-based approach to likelihood-free inference that is complementary to Approximate Bayesian Computation, and which does not require a prior on the model parameters. Experimental results on artificial problems with known exact likelihoods illustrate the potential of the proposed method.},

We found that the choice of performance metric is critical, that even state-of-the-art algorithms have substantial room for improvement, and that sequential estimation improves sample eﬃciency. Neural network-based approaches generally exhibit better performance, but there is no uniformly best algorithm.

Bertrand put into statistical form a variety of hypotheses, as for example the hypothesis that a given group of stars with relatively small angular distances between them as seen from the earth, form a “system” or group in space. His method of attack, which is that in common use, consisted essentially in calculating the probability, P, that a certain character, x, of the observed facts would arise if the hypothesis tested were true. If P were very small, this would generally be considered as an indication that the hypothesis, H, was probably false, and vice versa. Bertrand expressed the pessimistic view that no test of this kind could give reliable results. Borel, however, in a later discussion, considered that the method described could be applied with success provided that the character, x, of the observed facts were properly chosen—were, in fact, a character which he terms “en quelque sorte remarquable.”},

              A prescribed statistical model is a parametric specification of the distribution of a random vector, whilst an implicit statistical model is one defined at a more fundamental level in terms of a generating stochastic mechanism. This paper develops methods of inference which can be used for implicit statistical models whose distribution theory is intractable. The kernel method of probability density estimation is advocated for estimating a log‐likelihood from simulations of such a model. The development and testing of an algorithm for maximizing this estimated log‐likelihood function is described. An illustrative example involving a stochastic model for quantal response assays is given. Possible applications of the maximization algorithm to
              ad hoc
              methods of parameter estimation are noted briefly, and illustrated by an example involving a model for the spatial pattern of displaced amacrine cells in the retina of a rabbit.},

We adapt the training procedure of generative adversarial networks by replacing the differentiable generative network with a domain-specific simulator. We solve the resulting non-differentiable minimax problem by minimizing variational upper bounds of the two adversarial objectives. Effectively, the procedure results in learning a proposal distribution over simulator parameters, such that the JS divergence between the marginal distribution of the synthetic data and the empirical distribution of observed data is minimized.

	abstract = {High-resolution, spatially distributed process-based models are a well-established tool to explore complex watershed processes and how they may evolve under a changing climate. While these models are powerful, calibrating them can be 20 difficult because they are costly to run and have many unknown parameters. To solve this problem, we need a state-of-the-art, data- driven approach to model calibration that can scale to the high-compute, high-dimensional hydrologic simulators that drive innovation in our field today. Simulation- Based Inference (SBI) uses deep learning methods to learn a probability distribution of simulation parameters by comparing simulator outputs to observed data. The inferred parameters can then be used to run calibrated model simulations. This approach has pushed boundaries in simulator-intensive research from 25 cosmology, particle physics, and neuroscience, but is less familiar to hydrology. The goal of this paper is to introduce SBI to the field of watershed modeling by benchmarking and exploring its performance in a set of synthetic experiments. We use SBI to infer two common physical parameters of hydrologic process-based models, Manning’s Coefficient and Hydraulic Conductivity, in a snowmelt-dominated catchment in Colorado, USA. We employ a process-based simulator (ParFlow), streamflow observations, and several deep learning components to confront two recalcitrant issues related to calibrating 30 watershed models: 1) the high cost of running enough simulations to do a calibration; 2) finding ‘correct’ parameters when our understanding of the system is uncertain or incomplete. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate the power of SBI to conduct rapid and precise parameter inference for model calibration. The workflow we present is general-purpose, and we discuss how this can be adapted to other hydrology-related problems.},

However, the likelihood of a stellar density with respect to the stream and subhaloes parameters involves solving an intractable inverse problem which rests on the integration of all possible forward realisations implicitly defined by the simulation model. In order to infer the subhalo abundance, previous analyses have relied on Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) together with domain-motivated but handcrafted summary statistics. Here, we introduce a likelihood-free Bayesian inference pipeline based on Amortised Approximate Likelihood Ratios (AALR), which automatically learns a mapping between the data and the simulator parameters and obviates the need to handcraft a possibly insufficient summary statistic. We apply the method to the simplified case where stellar streams are only perturbed by dark matter subhaloes, thus neglecting baryonic substructures, and describe several diagnostics that demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method and the statistical quality of the learned estimator.},

	abstract = {Modeling complex conditional distributions is critical in a variety of settings. Despite a long tradition of research into conditional density estimation, current methods employ either simple parametric forms or are difﬁcult to learn in practice. This paper employs normalising ﬂows as a ﬂexible likelihood model and presents an efﬁcient method for ﬁtting them to complex densities. These estimators must trade-off between modeling distributional complexity, functional complexity and heteroscedasticity without overﬁtting. We recognize these trade-offs as modeling decisions and develop a Bayesian framework for placing priors over these conditional density estimators using variational Bayesian neural networks. We evaluate this method on several small benchmark regression datasets, on some of which it obtains state of the art performance. Finally, we apply the method to two spatial density modeling tasks with over 1 million datapoints using the New York City yellow taxi dataset and the Chicago crime dataset.},

In this extended abstract, we provide a proof of concept that demonstrates how the latest advances in neural simulation-based inference can speed up the inference time by up to three orders of magnitude – from days to minutes – without impairing the performance. Our approach is based on a convolutional neural network modeling the likelihood-to-evidence ratio and entirely amortizes the computation of the posterior.

We propose a multiclass framework free from the bias inherent to NRE-B at optimum, leaving us in the position to run diagnostics that practitioners depend on. It also recovers NRE-A in one corner case and NRE-B in the limiting case. For fair comparison, we benchmark the behavior of all algorithms in both familiar and novel training regimes: when jointly drawn data is unlimited, when data is ﬁxed but prior draws are unlimited, and in the commonplace ﬁxed data and parameters setting. Our investigations reveal that the highest performing models are distant from the competitors (NRE-A, NRE-B) in hyperparameter space. We make a recommendation for hyperparameters distinct from the previous models. We suggest a bound on the mutual information as a performance metric for simulation-based inference methods, without the need for posterior samples, and provide experimental results.},

	abstract = {Many statistical models can be simulated forwards but have intractable likelihoods. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods are used to infer properties of these models from data. Traditionally these methods approximate the posterior over parameters by conditioning on data being inside an -ball around the observed data, which is only correct in the limit → 0. Monte Carlo methods can then draw samples from the approximate posterior to approximate predictions or error bars on parameters. These algorithms critically slow down as → 0, and in practice draw samples from a broader distribution than the posterior. We propose a new approach to likelihood-free inference based on Bayesian conditional density estimation. Preliminary inferences based on limited simulation data are used to guide later simulations. In some cases, learning an accurate parametric representation of the entire true posterior distribution requires fewer model simulations than Monte Carlo ABC methods need to produce a single sample from an approximate posterior.},

	abstract = {Bayesian inference is a powerful framework for making probabilistic inferences and decisions under uncertainty. Fundamental choices in modern Bayesian workflows concern the specification of the likelihood function and prior distributions, the posterior approximator, and the data. Each choice can significantly influence model-based inference and subsequent decisions, thereby necessitating sensitivity analysis. In this work, we propose a multifaceted approach to integrate sensitivity analyses into amortized Bayesian inference (ABI, i.e., simulation-based inference with neural networks). First, we utilize weight sharing to encode the structural similarities between alternative likelihood and prior specifications in the training process with minimal computational overhead. Second, we leverage the rapid inference of neural networks to assess sensitivity to various data perturbations or pre-processing procedures. In contrast to most other Bayesian approaches, both steps circumvent the costly bottleneck of refitting the model(s) for each choice of likelihood, prior, or dataset. Finally, we propose to use neural network ensembles to evaluate variation in results induced by unreliable approximation on unseen data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in applied modeling problems, ranging from the estimation of disease outbreak dynamics and global warming thresholds to the comparison of human decision-making models. Our experiments showcase how our approach enables practitioners to effectively unveil hidden relationships between modeling choices and inferential conclusions.},

GATSBI reformulates the variational objective in an adversarial setting to learn implicit posterior distributions. Inference with GATSBI is amortised across observations, works in high-dimensional posterior spaces and supports implicit priors. We evaluate GATSBI on two SBI benchmark problems and on two high-dimensional simulators. On a model for wave propagation on the surface of a shallow water body, we show that GATSBI can return well-calibrated posterior estimates even in high dimensions. On a model of camera optics, it infers a high-dimensional posterior given an implicit prior, and performs better than a state-of-the-art SBI approach. We also show how GATSBI can be extended to perform sequential posterior estimation to focus on individual observations. Overall, GATSBI opens up opportunities for leveraging advances in GANs to perform Bayesian inference on high-dimensional simulation-based models.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Computational models of the cardiovascular system are widely used to simulate cardiac (dys)function. Personalization of such models for patient-specific simulation of cardiac function remains challenging. Measurement uncertainty affects accuracy of parameter estimations. In this study, we present a methodology for patient-specific estimation and uncertainty quantification of parameters in the closed-loop CircAdapt model of the human heart and circulation using echocardiographic deformation imaging. Based on patient-specific estimated parameters we aim to reveal the mechanical substrate underlying deformation abnormalities in patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC).Methods: We used adaptive multiple importance sampling to estimate the posterior distribution of regional myocardial tissue properties. This methodology is implemented in the CircAdapt cardiovascular modeling platform and applied to estimate active and passive tissue properties underlying regional deformation patterns, left ventricular volumes, and right ventricular diameter. First, we tested the accuracy of this method and its inter- and intraobserver variability using nine datasets obtained in AC patients. Second, we tested the trueness of the estimation using nine in silico generated virtual patient datasets representative for various stages of AC. Finally, we applied this method to two longitudinal series of echocardiograms of two pathogenic mutation carriers without established myocardial disease at baseline.Results: Tissue characteristics of virtual patients were accurately estimated with a highest density interval containing the true parameter value of 9\% (95\% CI [0–79]). Variances of estimated posterior distributions in patient data and virtual data were comparable, supporting the reliability of the patient estimations. Estimations were highly reproducible with an overlap in posterior distributions of 89.9\% (95\% CI [60.1–95.9]). Clinically measured deformation, ejection fraction, and end-diastolic volume were accurately simulated. In presence of worsening of deformation over time, estimated tissue properties also revealed functional deterioration.Conclusion: This method facilitates patient-specific simulation-based estimation of regional ventricular tissue properties from non-invasive imaging data, taking into account both measurement and model uncertainties. Two proof-of-principle case studies suggested that this cardiac digital twin technology enables quantitative monitoring of AC disease progression in early stages of disease.},

	abstract = {Population genetics encompasses a strong theoretical and applied research tradition on the multiple demographic processes that shape genetic variation present within a species. When several distinct populations exist in the current generation, it is often natural to consider the pattern of their divergence from a single ancestral population in terms of a binary tree structure. Inference about such population histories based on molecular data has been an intensive research topic in the recent years. The most common approach uses coalescent theory to model genealogies of individuals sampled from the current populations. Such methods are able to compare several different evolutionary scenarios and to estimate demographic parameters. However, their major limitation is the enormous computational complexity associated with the indirect modeling of the demographies, which limits the application to small data sets. Here, we propose a novel Bayesian method for inferring population histories from unlinked single nucleotide polymorphisms, which is applicable also to data sets harboring large numbers of individuals from distinct populations. We use an approximation to the neutral Wright–Fisher diffusion to model random fluctuations in allele frequencies. The population histories are modeled as binary rooted trees that represent the historical order of divergence of the different populations. A combination of analytical, numerical, and Monte Carlo integration techniques are utilized for the inferences. A particularly important feature of our approach is that it provides intuitive measures of statistical uncertainty related with the estimates computed, which may be entirely lacking for the alternative methods in this context. The potential of our approach is illustrated by analyses of both simulated and real data sets.},

This is normally done by means of standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, which require repeated expensive calculations involving the marginal likelihood. Motivated by the desire to avoid the inefficiencies of MCMC algorithms rejecting a considerable amount of expensive proposals, this paper develops an alternative inference framework based on adaptive multiple importance sampling (AMIS). In particular, this paper studies the application of AMIS for GPs in the case of a Gaussian likelihood, and proposes a novel pseudo-marginal-based AMIS algorithm for non-Gaussian likelihoods, where the marginal likelihood is unbiasedly estimated. The results suggest that the proposed framework outperforms MCMC-based inference of covariance parameters in a wide range of scenarios.},

In the standard IS approach, samples are drawn from a single proposal distribution and weighted adequately. However, since the performance in IS depends on the mismatch between the targeted and the proposal distributions, several proposal densities are often employed for the generation of samples. Under this multiple importance sampling (MIS) scenario, extensive literature has addressed the selection and adaptation of the proposal distributions, interpreting the sampling and weighting steps in different ways. In this paper, we establish a novel general framework with sampling and weighting procedures when more than one proposal is available. The new framework encompasses most relevant MIS schemes in the literature, and novel valid schemes appear naturally. All the MIS schemes are compared and ranked in terms of the variance of the associated estimators. Finally, we provide illustrative examples revealing that, even with a good choice of the proposal densities, a careful interpretation of the sampling and weighting procedures can make a significant difference in the performance of the method.},

	abstract = {The adaptive multiple importance sampling (AMIS) algorithm is a powerful Monte Carlo tool for Bayesian estimation in intractable models. The uniqueness of this methodology from other adaptive importance sampling (AIS) schemes is in the weighting procedure, where at each iteration of the algorithm, all samples are re-weighted according to the temporal deterministic mixture approach. This re-weighting allows for substantial variance reduction of the AMIS estimator, at the expense of an increased computational cost that grows quadratically with the number of iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel AIS methodology which obtains most of the AMIS variance reduction while improving upon its computational complexity. The proposed method implements an approximate version of the temporal deterministic mixture approach and requires substantially less computation. Advantages are shown empirically through a numerical example, where the novel method is able to attain a desired mean-squared error with much less computation.},

This allows one to benefit from the great variance reductions obtainable by importance sampling, while protecting against the equally great variance increases that might take the practitioner by surprise. The second improvement is to show how importance sampling from two or more densities can be used to approach a zero sampling variance even for integrands that take both positive and negative values.},

	abstract = {The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in zero-sum games such as chess. It is named after its creator Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-American physics professor.
The Elo system was invented as an improved chess-rating system over the previously used Harkness system, but is also used as a rating system in association football, American football, baseball, basketball, pool, table tennis, various board games and esports, and most recently large language models.
The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64\%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76\%.
A player's Elo rating is represented by a number which may change depending on the outcome of rated games played. After every game, the winning player takes points from the losing one. The difference between the ratings of the winner and loser determines the total number of points gained or lost after a game. If the higher-rated player wins, then only a few rating points will be taken from the lower-rated player. However, if the lower-rated player scores an upset win, many rating points will be transferred. The lower-rated player will also gain a few points from the higher rated player in the event of a draw. This means that this rating system is self-correcting. Players whose ratings are too low or too high should, in the long run, do better or worse correspondingly than the rating system predicts and thus gain or lose rating points until the ratings reflect their true playing strength.
Elo ratings are comparative only, and are valid only within the rating pool in which they were calculated, rather than being an absolute measure of a player's strength.},

	abstract = {We present QLoRA, an efficient finetuning approach that reduces memory usage enough to finetune a 65B parameter model on a single 48GB GPU while preserving full 16-bit finetuning task performance. QLoRA backpropagates gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters{\textasciitilde}(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3\% of the performance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a single GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without sacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is information theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double quantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We use QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of instruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets, multiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to run with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results show that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to state-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous SoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable alternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of chatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to ChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for 4-bit training.},

This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on.

	abstract = {Evaluating large language model (LLM) based chat assistants is challenging due to their broad capabilities and the inadequacy of existing benchmarks in measuring human preferences. To address this, we explore using strong LLMs as judges to evaluate these models on more open-ended questions. We examine the usage and limitations of LLM-as-a-judge, such as position and verbosity biases and limited reasoning ability, and propose solutions to migrate some of them. We then verify the agreement between LLM judges and human preferences by introducing two benchmarks: MT-bench, a multi-turn question set; and Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourced battle platform. Our results reveal that strong LLM judges like GPT-4 can match both controlled and crowdsourced human preferences well, achieving over 80\% agreement, the same level of agreement between humans. Hence, LLM-as-ajudge is a scalable and explainable way to approximate human preferences, which are otherwise very expensive to obtain. Additionally, we show our benchmark and traditional benchmarks complement each other by evaluating several variants of LLaMA/Vicuna. We will publicly release 80 MT-bench questions, 3K expert votes, and 30K conversations with human preferences from Chatbot Arena 2.},

This is done by calculating averages over the sample path of a Markov chain having π as its stationary distribution. For computational efficiency, the Markov chain should be rapidly mixing. This sometimes can be achieved only by careful design of the transition kernel of the chain, on the basis of a detailed preliminary exploratory analysis of π. An alternative approach might be to allow the transition kernel to adapt whenever new features of π are encountered during the MCMC run. However, if such adaptation occurs infinitely often, then the stationary distribution of the chain may be disturbed. We describe a framework, based on the concept of Markov chain regeneration, which allows adaptation to occur infinitely often but does not disturb the stationary distribution of the chain or the consistency of sample path averages.},

	abstract = {Modern sensor technologies, especially in biomedicine, produce increasingly detailed and informative image ensembles, many extremely complex. It will be argued that pattern theory can supply mathematical representations of subject-matter knowledge that can be used as a basis for algorithmic `understanding' of such pictures. After a brief survey of the basic principles of pattern theory we shall illustrate them by an application to a concrete situation: high magnification (greater than 15 000 ×) electron micrographs of cardiac muscle cells. The aim is to build algorithms for automatic hypothesis formation concerning the number, location, orientation and shape of mitochondria and membranes. For this we construct a pattern theoretic model in the form of a prior probability measure on the space of configurations describing these hypotheses. This measure is synthesized by solving sequentially a jump-diffusion equation of generalized Langevin form. The jumps occur for the creation-annihilation of hypotheses, corresponding to a jump from one continuum to another in configuration (hypothesis) space. These continua (subhypotheses) are expressed in terms of products of low dimensional Lie groups acting on the generators of a template. We use a modified Bayes approach to obtain the hypothesis formation, also organized by solving a generalized Langevin equation. To justify this it is shown that the resulting jump-diffusion process is ergodic so that the solution converges to the desired probability measure. To speed up the convergence we reduce the computation of the drift term in the stochastic differential equation analytically to a curvilinear integral, with the random term computed almost instantaneously. The algorithms thus obtained are implemented, both for mitochondria and membranes, on a 4000 processor parallel machine. Photographs of the graphics illustrate how automatic hypothesis formation is achieved. This approach is applied to deformable neuroanatomical atlases and tracking recognition from narrow band and high resolution sensor arrays.},

	abstract = {Particle filters (PFs) are powerful sampling­ based inference/learning algorithms for dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). They allow us to treat, in a principled way, any type of probabil­ ity distribution, nonlinearity and non-stationarity. They have appeared in several fields under such names as "condensation", "sequential Monte Carlo" and "survival of the fittest". In this pa­ per, we show how we can exploit the structure of the DBN to increase the efficiency of parti­ cle filtering, using a technique known as Rao­ Blackwellisation. Essentially, this samples some of the variables, and marginalizes out the rest exactly, using the Kalman filter, HMM filter, junction tree algorithm, or any other finite di­ mensional optimal filter. We show that Rao­ Blackwellised particle filters (RBPFs) lead to more accurate estimates than standard PFs. We demonstrate RBPFs on two problems, namely non-stationary online regression with radial ba­ sis function networks and robot localization and map building. We also discuss other potential ap­ plication areas and provide references to some fi­ nite dimensional optimal filters.},

The model only uses as inputs the number of reported cases and deaths, and was applied for the UK from April, 2020 to Sep, 2021 (daily data). The estimated infection rate has shown a trajectory in waves very compatible with the emergence of new variants and adopted social measures. The estimated mortality rate has shown a significant descendant behaviour in 2021, which we attribute to the vaccination program, and the estimated underreporting rate has been considerably volatile, with a downward tendency, implying that, on average, more people are testing than in the beginning of the pandemic. The evolution of the proportions of the population divided into susceptible, infected, recovered and dead groups are also shown with their confidence intervals and forecast, along with an estimation of the amount of reinfection that, according to our model, has become quite significant in 2021. Finally, the estimated trajectory of the effective reproduction rate has proven to be very compatible with the real number of cases and deaths. Its forecasts with confident intervals are also presented.},

	abstract = {A non-Gaussian state-space approach to the modeling of nonstationary time series is shown. The model is expressed in state-space form, where the system noise and the observational noise are not necessarily Gaussian. Recursive formulas of prediction, filtering, and smoothing for the state estimation and identification of the non-Gaussian state-space model are given. Also given is a numerical method based on piecewise linear approximation to the density functions for realizing these formulas. Significant merits of non-Gaussian modeling and the wide range of applicability of the method are illustrated by some numerical examples. A typical application of this non-Gaussian modeling is the smoothing of a time series that has mean value function with both abrupt and gradual changes. Simple Gaussian state-space modeling is not adequate for this situation. Here the model with small system noise variance cannot detect jump, whereas the one with large system noise variance yields unfavorable wiggle. To work out this problem within the ordinary linear Gaussian model framework, sophisticated treatment of outliers is required. But by the use of an appropriate non-Gaussian model for system noise, it is possible to reproduce both abrupt and gradual change of the mean without any special treatment. Nonstandard observations such as the ones distributed as non-Gaussian distribution can be easily treated by the direct modeling of an observational scheme. Smoothing of a transformed series such as a log periodogram can be treated by this method. Outliers in the observations can be treated as well by using heavy-tailed distribution for observational noise density. The algorithms herein can be easily extended to a wider class of models. As an example, the smoothing of nonhomogeneous binomial mean function is shown, where the observation is distributed according to a discrete random variable. Extension to a nonlinear system is also straightforward.},

This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood.

	abstract = {This paper analyses the recently suggested particle approach to filtering time series. We suggest that the algorithm is not robust to outliers for two reasons: the design of the simulators and the use of the discrete support to represent the sequentially updating prior distribution. Both problems are tackled in this paper. We believe we have largely solved the first problem and have reduced the order of magnitude of the second. In addition we introduce the idea of stratification into the particle filter which allows us to perform on-line Bayesian calculations about the parameters which index the models and maximum likelihood estimation. The new methods are illustrated by using a stochastic volatility model and a time series model of angles.

	abstract = {Accurate detection of pupil position in successive frames of eye videos is finding applications in many areas including assistive systems and E-learning. Processing the big datasets of eye videos in such systems requires robust and fast eye-tracking algorithms that can predict the position of eye pupil in consecutive video frames. As a major technique, particle filters provide adequate speed but have a low detection rate. To solve this problem, the present paper suggests the use of genetic algorithms in the sampling step of the particle filter technique. As a result, in each frame, the variety of particles required for predicting the pupil position in the next video frame is maintained and their uniformity is reduced. Finally, the speed and detection rate of the proposed method, as well as the basic particle filter method in predicting the pupil position in video frames are calculated and compared for various populations. The experimental results indicate that, in comparison with the basic particle filter algorithm, the proposed algorithm detects the pupil more accurately and in a shorter time. Also, by achieving an average detection rate of 79.89\% in estimation of the pupil center with an error of five pixels on a variety of eye videos with different situations of occlusion and illumination, not only the robustness of the proposed method is assessed but also its superiority to the state-of-the-art methods is evinced.},

Although asymptotic convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms is ensured under weak assumptions, the performance of these algorithms is unreliable when the proposal distributions that are used to explore the space are poorly chosen and/or if highly correlated variables are updated independently. We show here how it is possible to build efﬁcient high dimensional proposal distributions by using sequential Monte Carlo methods. This allows us not only to improve over standard Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes but also to make Bayesian inference feasible for a large class of statistical models where this was not previously so.

	abstract = {In many problems, complex non-Gaussian and/or nonlinear models are required to accurately describe a physical system of interest. In such cases, Monte-Carlo algorithms are remarkably flexible and extremely powerful approaches to solve such inference problems. However, in the presence of a high-dimensional and/or multimodal posterior distribution, it is widely documented that standard Monte-Carlo techniques could lead to poor performance. In this paper, the study is focused on a Sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) sampler framework, a more robust and efficient Monte-Carlo algorithm. Although this approach presents many advantages over traditional Monte-Carlo methods, the potential of this emergent technique is, however, largely underexploited in signal processing. In this paper, we aim at proposing some novel strategies to improve the efficiency and facilitate practical implementation of the SMC sampler. First, we propose an automatic and adaptive strategy that selects the sequence of distributions within the SMC sampler that minimizes the asymptotic variance of the estimator of the posterior normalization constant. The second original contribution we present improves the global efficiency of the SMC sampler by introducing a novel correction mechanism that allows the use of the particles generated through all of the iterations of the algorithm (instead of only particles from the last iteration). This is a significant contribution as it removes the need to discard a large portion of the samples obtained, as is standard in standard SMC methods. This will improve estimation performance in practical settings where the computational budget is important to consider.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by ﬁrst-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC’s performance is highly sensitive to two user-speciﬁed parameters: a step size and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as eﬃciently as (and sometimes more eﬃciently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter on the ﬂy based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require eﬃcient “turnkey” samplers.},

The current state x is first stochastically mapped to an ensemble, x{\textasciicircum}\{(1)\},...,x{\textasciicircum}\{(K)\}. This ensemble is then updated using MCMC updates that leave invariant a suitable ensemble density, rho(x{\textasciicircum}\{(1)\},...,x{\textasciicircum}\{(K)\}), defined in terms of pi(x{\textasciicircum}\{(i)\}) for i=1,...,K. Finally a single state is stochastically selected from the ensemble after these updates. Such ensemble MCMC updates can be useful when characteristics of pi and the ensemble permit pi(x{\textasciicircum}\{(i)\}) for all i in \{1,...,K\}, to be computed in less than K times the amount of computation time needed to compute pi(x) for a single x. One common situation of this type is when changes to some "fast" variables allow for quick re-computation of the density, whereas changes to other "slow" variables do not. Gaussian process regression models are an example of this sort of problem, with an overall scaling factor for covariances and the noise variance being fast variables. I show that ensemble MCMC for Gaussian process regression models can indeed substantially improve sampling performance. Finally, I discuss other possible applications of ensemble MCMC, and its relationship to the "multiple-try Metropolis" method of Liu, Liang, and Wong and the "multiset sampler" of Leman, Chen, and Lavine.},

In this paper we focus on two practical aspects of adaptive Metropolis samplers. First, we draw attention to the deficient performance of standard adaptation when the target distribution is multimodal. We propose a parallel chain adaptation strategy that incorporates multiple Markov chains which are run in parallel. Second, we note that the current adaptive MCMC paradigm implicitly assumes that the adaptation is uniformly efficient on all regions of the state space. However, in many practical instances, different “optimal” kernels are needed in different regions of the state space. We propose here a regional adaptation algorithm in which we account for possible errors made in defining the adaptation regions. This corresponds to the more realistic case in which one does not know exactly the optimal regions for adaptation. The methods focus on the random walk Metropolis sampling algorithm but their scope is much wider. We provide theoretical justification for the two adaptive approaches using the existent theory build for adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo. We illustrate the performance of the methods using simulations and analyze a mixture model for real data using an algorithm that combines the two approaches.},

	abstract = {The emergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods has opened a way for Bayesian analysis of complex models. Running MCMC samplers typically requires thousands of model evaluations, which can exceed available computer resources when this evaluation is computationally intensive. We will discuss two generally applicable techniques to improve the efficiency of MCMC. First, we consider a parallel version of the adaptive MCMC algorithm of Haario et al. (2001), implementing the idea of inter-chain adaptation introduced by Craiu et al. (2009). Second, we present an early rejection (ER) approach, where model simulation is stopped as soon as one can conclude that the proposed parameter value will be rejected by the MCMC algorithm. This work is motivated by practical needs in estimating parameters of climate and Earth system models. These computationally intensive models involve non-linear expressions of the geophysical and biogeochemical processes of the Earth system. Modeling of these processes, especially those operating in scales smaller than the model grid, involves a number of specified parameters, or ‘tunables’. MCMC methods are applicable for estimation of these parameters, but they are computationally very demanding. Efficient MCMC variants are thus needed to obtain reliable results in reasonable time. Here we evaluate the computational gains attainable through parallel adaptive MCMC and Early Rejection using both simple examples and a realistic climate model.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical models represent a challenging setting for inference algorithms. MCMC methods struggle to scale to large models with many local variables and observations, and variational inference (VI) may fail to provide accurate approximations due to the use of simple variational families. Some variational methods (e.g. importance weighted VI) integrate Monte Carlo methods to give better accuracy, but these tend to be unsuitable for hierarchical models, as they do not allow for subsampling and their performance tends to degrade for high dimensional models. We propose a new family of variational bounds for hierarchical models, based on the application of tightening methods (e.g. importance weighting) separately for each group of local random variables. We show that our approach naturally allows the use of subsampling to get unbiased gradients, and that it fully leverages the power of methods that build tighter lower bounds by applying them independently in lower dimensional spaces, leading to better results and more accurate posterior approximations than relevant baselines.},

	abstract = {Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) or Energy Disaggregation, seeks to save energy by decomposing corresponding appliances power reading from an aggregate power reading of the whole house. It is regarded as a single channel blind source separation problem to extract sources from a mixed signal. Recent studies have shown that deep learning is widely applied to NILM problem. Theoretically,the ability of any neural network to extract load features is closely related to its depth. However, a deep neural network is difficult to train because of exploding gradient, vanishing gradient, and network degradation. Therefore, Bi-TCN residual block, inspired by a temporal convolution network (TCN), is applied to solve these problems. Causal dilated convolution is replaced by bidirectional(non-causal) dilated convolution to enlarge the receptive field of network and improve the performance of model. Two forms of residual connections are introduced to deep models. One is designed to facilitate training deep models, and the other is pursuing performance-boosting by combining load features extracted of different hierarchical levels to final prediction. We propose a sequence to point learning based on bidirectional dilated convolution for NILM on low-frequency data, called BitcnNILM. We compare our method with existing algorithms on low-frequency data via REDD and UK-DALE datasets. Experiments show that the superiority of our BitcnNILM in both load disaggregation and load on/off identification.},

Given the text, Diff-TTS exploits a denoising diffusion framework to transform the noise signal into a mel-spectrogram via diffusion time steps. In order to learn the mel-spectrogram distribution conditioned on the text, we present a likelihood-based optimization method for TTS. Furthermore, to boost up the inference speed, we leverage the accelerated sampling method that allows Diff-TTS to generate raw waveforms much faster without signiﬁcantly degrading perceptual quality. Through experiments, we veriﬁed that Diff-TTS generates 28 times faster than the real-time with a single NVIDIA 2080Ti GPU.},

In this work, we focus on a middle ground of neural synthesizers that can generate audio from MIDI sequences with arbitrary combinations of instruments in realtime. This enables training on a wide range of transcription datasets with a single model, which in turn offers notelevel control of composition and instrumentation across a wide range of instruments. We use a simple two-stage process: MIDI to spectrograms with an encoder-decoder Transformer, then spectrograms to audio with a generative adversarial network (GAN) spectrogram inverter. We compare training the decoder as an autoregressive model and as a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and ﬁnd that the DDPM approach is superior both qualitatively and as measured by audio reconstruction and Fréchet distance metrics. Given the interactivity and generality of this approach, we ﬁnd this to be a promising ﬁrst step towards interactive and expressive neural synthesis for arbitrary combinations of instruments and notes.},

We ﬁrst propose that a ‘local’ scale should be used to compute the afﬁnity between each pair of points. This local scaling leads to better clustering especially when the data includes multiple scales and when the clusters are placed within a cluttered background. We further suggest exploiting the structure of the eigenvectors to infer automatically the number of groups.

	abstract = {Importance sampling (IS) is a powerful Monte Carlo (MC) methodology for approximating integrals, for instance in the context of Bayesian inference. In IS, the samples are simulated from the so-called proposal distribution, and the choice of this proposal is key for achieving a high performance. In adaptive IS (AIS) methods, a set of proposals is iteratively improved. AIS is a relevant and timely methodology although many limitations remain yet to be overcome, e.g., the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional and multi-modal problems. Moreover, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm has become increasingly popular in machine learning and statistics. HMC has several appealing features such as its exploratory behavior, especially in high-dimensional targets, when other methods suffer. In this paper, we introduce the novel Hamiltonian adaptive importance sampling (HAIS) method. HAIS implements a two-step adaptive process with parallel HMC chains that cooperate at each iteration. The proposed HAIS efﬁciently adapts a population of proposals, extracting the advantages of HMC. HAIS can be understood as a particular instance of the generic layered AIS family with an additional resampling step. HAIS achieves a signiﬁcant performance improvement in high-dimensional problems w.r.t. state-of-the-art algorithms. We discuss the statistical properties of HAIS and show its high performance in two challenging examples.},

Inference in the simpiﬁed model provides bounds on probabilities of interest in the original model. We describe a general framework for generating variational transformations based on convex duality.

	abstract = {Probabilistic programming promises to simplify and democratize probabilistic machine learning, but successful probabilistic programming systems require flexible, generic and efficient inference engines. In this work, we present a system called Turing for building MCMC algorithms for probabilistic programming inference. Turing has a very simple syntax and makes full use of the numerical capabilities in the Julia programming language, including all implemented probability distributions, and automatic differentiation. Turing supports a wide range of popular Monte Carlo algorithms, including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), HMC with No-U-Turns (NUTS), Gibbs sampling, sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), and several particle MCMC (PMCMC) samplers. Most importantly, Turing inference is composable: it combines MCMC operations on subsets of variables, for example using a combination of an HMC engine and a particle Gibbs (PG) engine.  We explore several combinations of inference methods with the aim of finding approaches that are both efficient and universal, i.e. applicable to arbitrary probabilistic models. NUTS—a popular variant of HMC that adapts Hamiltonian simulation path length automatically, although quite powerful for exploring differentiable target distributions, is however not universal. We identify some failure modes for the NUTS engine, and demonstrate that composition of PG (for discrete variables) and NUTS (for continuous variables) can be useful when the NUTS engine is either not applicable, or simply does not work well. Our aim is to present Turing and its composable inference engines to the world and encourage other researchers to build on this system to help advance the field of probabilistic machine learning.},

	abstract = {Training deep directed graphical models with many hidden variables and performing inference remains a major challenge. Helmholtz machines and deep belief networks are such models, and the wake-sleep algorithm has been proposed to train them. The wake-sleep algorithm relies on training not just the directed generative model but also a conditional generative model (the inference network) that runs backward from visible to latent, estimating the posterior distribution of latent given visible. We propose a novel interpretation of the wake-sleep algorithm which suggests that better estimators of the gradient can be obtained by sampling latent variables multiple times from the inference network. This view is based on importance sampling as an estimator of the likelihood, with the approximate inference network as a proposal distribution. This interpretation is conﬁrmed experimentally, showing that better likelihood can be achieved with this reweighted wake-sleep procedure. Based on this interpretation, we propose that a sigmoidal belief network is not sufﬁciently powerful for the layers of the inference network in order to recover a good estimator of the posterior distribution of latent variables. Our experiments show that using a more powerful layer model, such as NADE, yields substantially better generative models.},

It typically makes strong assumptions about posterior inference, for instance that the posterior distribution is approximately factorial, and that its parameters can be approximated with nonlinear regression from the observations. As we show empirically, the VAE objective can lead to overly simpliﬁed representations which fail to use the network’s entire modeling capacity. We present the importance weighted autoencoder (IWAE), a generative model with the same architecture as the VAE, but which uses a strictly tighter log-likelihood lower bound derived from importance weighting. In the IWAE, the recognition network uses multiple samples to approximate the posterior, giving it increased ﬂexibility to model complex posteriors which do not ﬁt the VAE modeling assumptions. We show empirically that IWAEs learn richer latent space representations than VAEs, leading to improved test log-likelihood on density estimation benchmarks.},

We do so by proposing multiple points in parallel, then constructing and sampling from a finite-state Markov chain on the proposed points such that the overall procedure has the correct target density as its stationary distribution. Our approach is generally applicable and straightforward to implement. We demonstrate how this construction may be used to greatly increase the computational speed and statistical efficiency of a variety of existing MCMC methods, including Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithms and Adaptive MCMC. Furthermore, we show how it allows for a principled way of using every integration step within Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods; our approach increases robustness to the choice of algorithmic parameters and results in increased accuracy of Monte Carlo estimates with little extra computational cost.},

	abstract = {Multi-sample, importance-weighted variational autoencoders (IWAE) give tighter bounds and more accurate uncertainty estimates than variational autoencoders (VAE) trained with a standard single-sample objective. However, IWAEs scale poorly: as the latent dimensionality grows, they require exponentially many samples to retain the beneﬁts of importance weighting. While sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) can address this problem, it is prohibitively slow because the resampling step imposes sequential structure which cannot be parallelised, and moreover, resampling is nondifferentiable which is problematic when learning approximate posteriors. To address these issues, we developed tensor Monte-Carlo (TMC) which gives exponentially many importance samples by separately drawing K samples for each of the n latent variables, then averaging over all Kn possible combinations. While the sum over exponentially many terms might seem to be intractable, in many cases it can be computed efﬁciently as a series of tensor inner-products. We show that TMC is superior to IWAE on a generative model with multiple stochastic layers trained on the MNIST handwritten digit database, and we show that TMC can be combined with standard variance reduction techniques.},

A typical PBM experiment can measure binding signal intensities of a protein to all the possible DNA k-mers (k = 8 ∼10); such comprehensive binding affinity data usually need to be reduced and represented as motif models before they can be further analyzed and applied. Since proteins can often bind to DNA in multiple modes, one of the major challenges is to decompose the comprehensive affinity data into multimodal motif representations. Here, we describe a new algorithm that uses Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and can derive precise and multimodal motifs using belief propagations. We describe an HMM-based approach using belief propagations (kmerHMM), which accepts and preprocesses PBM probe raw data into median-binding intensities of individual k-mers. The k-mers are ranked and aligned for training an HMM as the underlying motif representation. Multiple motifs are then extracted from the HMM using belief propagations. Comparisons of kmerHMM with other leading methods on several data sets demonstrated its effectiveness and uniqueness. Especially, it achieved the best performance on more than half of the data sets. In addition, the multiple binding modes derived by kmerHMM are biologically meaningful and will be useful in interpreting other genome-wide data such as those generated from ChIP-seq. The executables and source codes are available at the authors’ websites: e.g. http://www.cs.toronto.edu/∼wkc/kmerHMM.},

	abstract = {Learning a classifier from positive and unlabeled data is an important class of classification problems that are conceivable in many practical applications. In this paper, we first show that this problem can be solved by cost-sensitive learning between positive and unlabeled data. We then show that convex surrogate loss functions such as the hinge loss may lead to a wrong classification boundary due to an intrinsic bias, but the problem can be avoided by using non-convex loss functions such as the ramp loss. We next analyze the excess risk when the class prior is estimated from data, and show that the classification accuracy is not sensitive to class prior estimation if the unlabeled data is dominated by the positive data (this is naturally satisfied in inlier-based outlier detection because inliers are dominant in the unlabeled dataset). Finally, we provide generalization error bounds and show that, for an equal number of labeled and unlabeled samples, the generalization error of learning only from positive and unlabeled samples is no worse than 2√2 times the fully supervised case. These theoretical findings are also validated through experiments.},

	abstract = {Personalized web services strive to adapt their services (advertisements, news articles, etc) to individual users by making use of both content and user information. Despite a few recent advances, this problem remains challenging for at least two reasons. First, web service is featured with dynamically changing pools of content, rendering traditional collaborative filtering methods inapplicable. Second, the scale of most web services of practical interest calls for solutions that are both fast in learning and computation. In this work, we model personalized recommendation of news articles as a contextual bandit problem, a principled approach in which a learning algorithm sequentially selects articles to serve users based on contextual information about the users and articles, while simultaneously adapting its article-selection strategy based on user-click feedback to maximize total user clicks. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we propose a new, general contextual bandit algorithm that is computationally efficient and well motivated from learning theory. Second, we argue that any bandit algorithm can be reliably evaluated offline using previously recorded random traffic. Finally, using this offline evaluation method, we successfully applied our new algorithm to a Yahoo! Front Page Today Module dataset containing over 33 million events. Results showed a 12.5\% click lift compared to a standard context-free bandit algorithm, and the advantage becomes even greater when data gets more scarce.},

We propose KernelUCB, a kernelised UCB algorithm, and give a cumulative regret bound through a frequentist analysis. For contextual bandits, the related algorithm GP-UCB turns out to be a special case of our algorithm, and our finite-time analysis improves the regret bound of GP-UCB for the agnostic case, both in the terms of the kernel-dependent quantity and the RKHS norm of the reward function. Moreover, for the linear kernel, our regret bound matches the lower bound for contextual linear bandits.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning policies face the exploration versus exploitation dilemma, i.e. the search for a balance between exploring the environment to find profitable actions while taking the empirically best action as often as possible. A popular measure of a policy's success in addressing this dilemma is the regret, that is the loss due to the fact that the globally optimal policy is not followed all the times. One of the simplest examples of the exploration/exploitation dilemma is the multi-armed bandit problem. Lai and Robbins were the first ones to show that the regret for this problem has to grow at least logarithmically in the number of plays. Since then, policies which asymptotically achieve this regret have been devised by Lai and Robbins and many others. In this work we show that the optimal logarithmic regret is also achievable uniformly over time, with simple and efficient policies, and for all reward distributions with bounded support.},

Our technique for designing and analyzing algorithms for such situations is very general and can be applied when an algorithm has to make exploitation-versus-exploration decisions based on uncertain information provided by a random process. We consider two models with such an exploitation/exploration trade-off. For the adversarial bandit problem our new algorithm suffers only O/spl tilde/(T/sup 1/2/) regret over T trials which improves significantly over the previously best O/spl tilde/(T/sup 2/3/) regret. We also extend our results for the adversarial bandit problem to shifting bandits. The second model we consider is associative reinforcement learning with linear value functions. For this model our technique improves the regret from O/spl tilde/(T/sup 3/4/) to O/spl tilde/(T/sup 1/2/).},

Knowledge of these measures can then be used to compare competing designs, such as round-robin, pure knockout and hybrids of these designs. We show, for example, how the design of the tournament influences the outcome uncertainty of the tournament and the number of unimportant matches within the tournament. In this way, where new designs are proposed, the implications of these designs may be explored within a modelling paradigm. In football (soccer), the UEFA Champions League has adopted a number of designs over its 50 year history; the design of the tournament has been modified principally in response to the changing demands of national league football and television – the paper uses this particular tournament to illustrate the methodology.},

Our methodology uses tournament outcome uncertainty to consider the effect of seeding policy and other design changes. The tournament outcome uncertainty is measured using the tournament outcome characteristic which is the probability Pq,R that a team in the top 100q pre-tournament rank percentile progresses forward from round R, for all q and R. We use Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the values of this metric.

	abstract = {Playing in the FIFA World Cup finals is an ambition shared by several nations. Since, besides luck and skill, the probability of qualification depends on the design of the qualifiers, the study of these competitions forms an integral part of sports analytics. The Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) announced a novel qualifying format for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in July 2019. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the organisers to return to a more traditional structure. The present chapter analyses how this reform impacted the chances of the national teams to qualify. It is found that the probability of participating in the FIFA World Cup finals can change by more than 5 percentage points under the assumption of fixed strengths for the teams. The idea behind the original design, to divide the contestants into two distinct sets, is worth considering due to the increased competitiveness of the matches played by the strongest and the weakest teams. We recommend mitigating the sharp nonlinearity caused by the seeding policy via a probabilistic rule to the analogy of the NBA draft lottery system.},

They are evaluated via Monte-Carlo simulations under six different assumptions on winning probabilities. Comparing the same pairs of alternatives multiple times turns out to be an inefficacious policy. The Swiss-system is found to be the most accurate among all these designs, especially in its ability to rank all participants. A possible explanation is that it does not eliminate an alternative after a single loss, while it takes the history of the comparisons into account. Hence, this particular format may deserve more attention from the decision-makers such as the governing bodies of major sports.},

	abstract = {We consider the situation where I items are ranked by paired comparisons. It is usually assumed that the probability that item i is preferred over item j is pij = F (µi −µj) where F is a symmetric distribution function, which we refer to as the comparison function, and µi and µj are the merits or scores of the compared items. This modelling framework, which is ubiquitous in the paired comparison literature, strongly depends on the assumption that the comparison function F is known. In practice, however, this assumption is often unrealistic and may result in poor ﬁt and erroneous inferences. This limitation has motivated us to relax the assumption that F is fully known and simultaneously estimate the merits of the objects and the underlying comparison function. Our formulation yields a ﬂexible semi-deﬁnite programming problem that we use as a reﬁnement step for estimating the paired comparison probability matrix. We provide a detailed sensitivity analysis and, as a result, we establish the consistency of the resulting estimators and provide bounds on the estimation and approximation errors. Some statistical properties of the resulting estimators as well as model selection criteria are investigated. Finally, using a large data-set of computer chess matches, we estimate the comparison function and ﬁnd that the model used by the International Chess Federation does not seem to apply to computer chess.},

	url = {https://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/handle/1840.16/3102},
	abstract = {The rank of an object is its relative importance to the other objects in a finite set of size n. Often a rank is an integer assigned from the set \{ 1,2,...,n\}. Ideally an assignment of available ranks (\{1,2,...,n\}) to n objects is one-to-one. However in certain circumstances it is possible that more than one object is assigned the same rank. A ranking model is a method of determining a way in which the ranks are assigned. Typically a ranking model uses information available to determine a rating for each object. The ratings carry more information than the ranks; they provide us with the degree of relative importance of each object. Once we have the ratings the assignment of ranks can be as simple as sorting the objects in descending order of the corresponding ratings. Ranking models can be used for a number of applications such as sports, web search, literature search, etc. The type of ranking investigated in this work has close ties with the Method of Paired Comparison. Oftentimes the information that is the easiest to obtain or naturally available is the relative preference of the objects taken two at a time. The information is then summarized in a weighted directed graph and hence as the corresponding matrix. A number of ranking models makes use of the matrix representation of paired comparisons to compute ratings of the individual objects. Two ranking models proposed and investigated in this work start with forming nonegative matrices that do represent certain pairwise type comparisons. The models have different approaches to computing the rating scores. The Offense-Defense Model makes use of the Sinkhorn-Knopp Theorem on equivalence matrix balancing, whereas the Generalized Markov model is based on Markov Chain theory. Both models are then used to compute the ratings of the National Football League teams, National Collegiate Athletic Association football and basketball teams. The ratings are used to perform game predictions. The proposed models are not specific to sports and can be applied to any situation consisting of a set of objects and a set of pairwise information. However, picking team sports as a ranking application allows for unrestricted access of free and abundant data. The game predictions experiments consisted of both foresight and hindsight predictions. All the experiments included the proposed models as well as several current sports ranking methods.},

As a conclusion, single elimination is best if we want to qualify one winner only, all matches conducted are exciting in term of competitiveness. Double elimination with proper seeding system is a better choice if we want to qualify more winners. A reasonable number of extra matches need to be conducted in exchange of being able to qualify top four winners. Round-robin gives reliable ranking precision for all participants.

Our bound results from the analysis of a very simple randomised procedure using the so-called entropy compression method. We show that the expected running time of the procedure is O(mn∆2 log ∆), where n and m are the number of vertices and edges of G.

We consider recent formulations of the algorithmic Lovasz Local Lemma by Achlioptas-Iliopoulos-Kolmogorov [2] and by Achlioptas-Iliopoulos-Sinclair [3]. These papers analyze a random walk algorithm for finding objects that avoid undesired "bad events" (or "flaws"), and prove that under certain conditions the algorithm is guaranteed to find a "flawless" object quickly. We show that conditions proposed in these papers are incomparable, and introduce a new family of conditions that includes those in [2, 3] as special cases. 
Secondly, we extend our previous notion of "commutativity" in [15] to this more general setting, and prove that it allows to use an arbitrary strategy for selecting the next flaw to address. In the special case of primary flaws we prove a stronger property: the flaw selection strategy does not affect at all the expected number of steps until termination, and also does not affect the distribution induced by the algorithm upon termination. This applies, in particular, to the single-clause backtracking algorithm for constraint satisfaction problems considered in [3].},

Such networks possess a rich set of scaling properties. A number of them are scale-free and show striking resilience against random breakdowns. In spite of the large sizes of these networks, the distances between most of their vertices are short - a feature known as the 'small-world' effect. We discuss how growing networks self-organize into scale-free structures, and investigate the role of the mechanism of preferential linking. We consider the topological and structural properties of evolving networks, and percolation and disease spread on these networks.

The initial route set generation algorithm aims to generate high-quality initial solutions for succeeding optimization procedures. To explore the solution space and to have solutions with a different number of routes, a route set size alternating heuristic is developed to change the number of routes in a solution by adding or deleting one route. Experiments were performed on Mandl’s network and four larger Mumford’s networks. Compared with a fixed route set size approach, the proposed NSGA-II-based solution method can produce an approximate Pareto front with much higher solution quality as well as improved computation efficiency.},

Our work is inspired by Moser's entropic method proof of the Lovasz Local Lemma (LLL) for satisfiability and completely bypasses the Probabilistic Method formulation of the LLL. In particular, our method works when the underlying state space is entirely unstructured.

We resolve this by developing a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for such applications.

	abstract = {Recent work on the structure of social networks and the internet has focused attention on graphs with distributions of vertex degree that are significantly different from the Poisson degree distributions that have been widely studied in the past. In this paper we develop in detail the theory of random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions. In addition to simple undirected, unipartite graphs, we examine the properties of directed and bipartite graphs. Among other results, we derive exact expressions for the position of the phase transition at which a giant component first forms, the mean component size, the size of the giant component if there is one, the mean number of vertices a certain distance away from a randomly chosen vertex, and the average vertex-vertex distance within a graph. We apply our theory to some real-world graphs, including the world-wide web and collaboration graphs of scientists and Fortune 1000 company directors. We demonstrate that in some cases random graphs with appropriate distributions of vertex degree predict with surprising accuracy the behavior of the real world, while in others there is a measurable discrepancy between theory and reality, perhaps indicating the presence of additional social structure in the network that is not captured by the random graph., This article appears in the following collections:},

	abstract = {The Lovász local lemma (LLL) [P. Erdös and L. Lovász, Problems and results on 3-chromatic hypergraphs and some related questions, in Infinite and Finite Sets, Vol. II, A. Hajnal, R. Rado, and V. T. Sós, eds., North--Holland, Amsterdam, 1975, pp. 609--627] is a powerful result in probability theory that informally states the following: the probability that none of a set of bad events happens is positive if the probability of each event is small compared to the number of events that depend on it. The LLL is often used for nonconstructive existence proofs of combinatorial structures. A prominent application is to \$k\$-CNF formulas, where the LLL implies that if every clause in a formula shares variables with at most \$d {\textbackslash}leq 2{\textasciicircum}k/e-1\$ other clauses, then such a formula has a satisfying assignment. Recently, a randomized algorithm to efficiently construct a satisfying assignment in this setting was given by Moser [A constructive proof of the Lovász local lemma, in STOC '09: Proceedings of the 41st Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, ACM, New York, 2009, pp. 343--350]. Subsequently Moser and Tardos [J. ACM, 57 (2010), pp. 11:1--11:15] gave a general algorithmic framework for the LLL and a randomized algorithm within this framework to construct the structures guaranteed by the LLL. The main problem left open by Moser and Tardos was to design an efficient deterministic algorithm for constructing structures guaranteed by the LLL. In this paper we provide such an algorithm. Our algorithm works in the general framework of Moser and Tardos with a minimal loss in parameters. For the special case of constructing satisfying assignments for \$k\$-CNF formulas with \$m\$ clauses, where each clause shares variables with at most \$d {\textbackslash}leq 2{\textasciicircum}\{k/(1+{\textbackslash}epsilon)\}/e - 1\$ other clauses, for any \${\textbackslash}epsilon{\textbackslash}in (0,1)\$, we give a deterministic algorithm that finds a satisfying assignment in time \${\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}(m{\textasciicircum}\{2(1+1/{\textbackslash}epsilon)\})\$. This improves upon the deterministic algorithms of Moser and of Moser and Tardos with running times \$m{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}Omega(k{\textasciicircum}2)\}\$ and \$m{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}Omega(d {\textbackslash}log d)\}\$, respectively, which are superpolynomial for \$k={\textbackslash}omega(1)\$ and \$d={\textbackslash}omega(1)\$, and upon the previous best deterministic algorithm of Beck, which runs in polynomial time only for \$d{\textbackslash}leq 2{\textasciicircum}\{k/16\}/4\$. Our algorithm is the first deterministic algorithm that works in the general framework of Moser and Tardos. We also give a parallel NC algorithm for the same setting, improving upon an algorithm of Alon [Random Structures Algorithms, 2 (1991), pp. 367--378].},

The same technique is also applied to improve corresponding bounds for graphs with bounded girth. An interesting aspect of this application is that the probability of the “undesirable” events do not have a uniform upper bound, i.e. it constitutes a case of the asymmetric Lov´asz Local Lemma.},

Kratochvil et al. applied this technique to prove that a k-CNF in which each variable appears at most 2{\textasciicircum}k/(ek) times is always satisfiable [KST93]. In a breakthrough paper, Beck found that if we lower the occurrences to O(2{\textasciicircum}(k/48)/k), then a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm can find a satisfying assignment to such an instance [Bec91]. Alon randomized the algorithm and required O(2{\textasciicircum}(k/8)/k) occurrences [Alo91]. In [Mos06], we exhibited a refinement of his method which copes with O(2{\textasciicircum}(k/6)/k) of them. The hitherto best known randomized algorithm is due to Srinivasan and is capable of solving O(2{\textasciicircum}(k/4)/k) occurrence instances [Sri08]. Answering two questions asked by Srinivasan, we shall now present an approach that tolerates O(2{\textasciicircum}(k/2)/k) occurrences per variable and which can most easily be derandomized. The new algorithm bases on an alternative type of witness tree structure and drops a number of limiting aspects common to all previous methods.},

Assume that the probability of an individual variable belonging to the scope of an occurring event is bounded by \$q\$. We prove that if \$ekq {\textbackslash}leq 1\$ then there exists at least one assignment to the variables for which none of the events occurs. This result is stronger than the classical version of the Lov{\textbackslash}'asz local lemma, which is expressed in terms of a bound \$p\$ of the probabilities of the individual events, and of \$d\$, a bound on the degree of the dependency graph. The proof is through a public coin, interactive implementation of the algorithm by Moser. The original implementation, which yields the classical result, finds efficiently, but probabilistically, an assignment to the events that avoids all undesirable events. Interestingly, the interactive implementation given in this work does not constitute an efficient, even if probabilistic, algorithm to find an assignment as desired under the weaker assumption \$ekq {\textbackslash}leq 1\$. We can only conclude that under this hypothesis, the interactive protocol will produce an assignment as desired within \$n\$ rounds, with probability high with respect to \$n\$; however, the provers' (Merlin's) choices remain non-deterministic. Plausibly finding such an assignment is inherently hard, as the situation is reminiscent, in a probabilistic framework, of problems complete for syntactic subclasses of TFNP.},

LCAs under those stronger conditions were given in [38], where it was asked if the Moser-Tardos algorithm can be used to design LCAs under the standard LLL condition. The main contribution of this paper is to answer this question affirmatively. In fact, our techniques yield LCAs for settings beyond the standard LLL condition.},

	abstract = {The Lov´asz Local Lemma [EL75] is a powerful tool to prove the existence of combinatorial objects meeting a prescribed collection of criteria. The technique can directly be applied to the satisﬁability problem, yielding that a k-CNF formula in which each clause has common variables with at most 2k−2 other clauses is always satisﬁable. All hitherto known proofs of the Local Lemma are non-constructive and do thus not provide a recipe as to how a satisfying assignment to such a formula can be eﬃciently found. In his breakthrough paper [Bec91], Beck demonstrated that if the neighbourhood of each clause be restricted to O(2k/48), a polynomial time algorithm for the search problem exists. Alon simpliﬁed and randomized his procedure and improved the bound to O(2k/8) [Alo91]. Srinivasan presented in [Sri08] a variant that achieves a bound of essentially O(2k/4). In [Mos08], we improved this to O(2k/2). In the present paper, we give a randomized algorithm that ﬁnds a satisfying assignment to every k-CNF formula in which each clause has a neighbourhood of at most the asymptotic optimum of 2k−5 − 1 other clauses and that runs in expected time polynomial in the size of the formula, irrespective of k. If k is considered a constant, we can also give a deterministic variant. In contrast to all previous approaches, our analysis does not anymore invoke the standard non-constructive versions of the Local Lemma and can therefore be considered an alternative, constructive proof of it.},

The determination of a suite of “optimal” waveforms in the Pareto sense is found a priori for a single platform radar system performing multiple radar missions simultaneously. The waveform suite is determined by utilizing a Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm to find solutions to a Multi-Objective Optimization Problem (MOP). The objectives to be optimized are dictated by the particular missions of interest. The mapping of these objective functions to actual radar performance parameters is used in the SPEA to determine how best to simultaneously perform multiple radar missions such as GMTI, AMTI, and SAR using a single radar system. Most evolutionary algorithms, GA’s being no exception, include constraints. In practical problems such as waveform design, these constraints are based on physical limitations. By developing objective functions that are mapped to mission performance via waveform parameters (the solution space for our application) we have developed a method for searching a vast solution space to determine Pareto optimal waveform suites that can be used to simultaneously perform multiple radar missions. We have proposed using orthogonal waveforms as a constraint due to the natural separation of such signals in frequency space as well as practical state-of-the art hardware implementation feasibility.},

	abstract = {We introduce a simple evolution scheme for multiobjective optimization problems, called the Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy (PAES). We argue that PAES may represent the simplest possible nontrivial algorithm capable of generating diverse solutions in the Pareto optimal set. The algorithm, in its simplest form, is a (1 + 1) evolution strategy employing local search but using a reference archive of previously found solutions in order to identify the approximate dominance ranking of the current and candidate solution vectors. (1 + 1)PAES is intended to be a baseline approach against which more involved methods may be compared. It may also serve well in some real-world applications when local search seems superior to or competitive with population-based methods. We introduce (1 + ) and ( + ) variants of PAES as extensions to the basic algorithm. Six variants of PAES are compared to variants of the Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm and the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm over a diverse suite of six test functions. Results are analyzed and presented using techniques that reduce the attainment surfaces generated from several optimization runs into a set of univariate distributions. This allows standard statistical analysis to be carried out for comparative purposes. Our results provide strong evidence that PAES performs consistently well on a range of multiobjective optimization tasks.},

If the agent is a passive observer, then the optimal solution is the well-known Bayesian predictor. However, if the agent is active, then its past actions need to be treated as causal interventions on the I/O stream rather than normal probability conditions. Here it is shown that the solution to this new variational problem is given by a stochastic controller called the Bayesian control rule, which implements adaptive behavior as a mixture of experts. Furthermore, it is shown that under mild assumptions, the Bayesian control rule converges to the control law of the most suitable expert.},

To tackle the traveling salesman problem using genetic algorithms, there are various representations such as binary, path, adjacency, ordinal, and matrix representations. In this article, we propose a new crossover operator for traveling salesman problem to minimize the total distance. This approach has been linked with path representation, which is the most natural way to represent a legal tour. Computational results are also reported with some traditional path representation methods like partially mapped and order crossovers along with new cycle crossover operator for some benchmark TSPLIB instances and found improvements.},

This operator is diﬀerent from past operators that emphasized edges in that 95compose the oﬀspring are inherited from one of the two parents. The recombination operator does not use information about the distance between cities or any heuristic operators. This operator has found known solutions and matched ”best known” solutions for every problem on which it has been tested. The functionality of this new operator can be explained using a variation on Holland’s original schema theorem. Because this operator uses no information about the actual cost associated with edges and requires the use of no additional heuristics, it can also be used on sequencing problems where there are no actual distances to measure, but rather only some overall evaluation of the total sequence. An example is given of how this operator has been used to generate job shop schedules.},

Tabu search is one of the most widely applied metaheuristic for solving the TSP. In this paper, we review the tabu search literature on the TSP and its variations, point out trends in it, and bring out some interesting research gaps in this literature.},

	abstract = {Results indicate that tabu search consistently outperforms simulated annealing with respect to computation time while giving comparable solutions to traveling salesman problem problems. This paper describes serial and parallel implementations of two different search techniques applied to the traveling salesman problem. A novel approach has been taken to parallelize simulated annealing and the results are compared with the traditional annealing algorithm. This approach uses abbreviated cooling schedule and achieves a superlinear speedup. Also a new search technique, called tabu search, has been adapted to execute in a parallel computing environment. Comparison between simulated annealing and tabu search indicate that tabu search consistently outperforms simulated annealing with respect to computation time while giving comparable solutions. Examples include 25, 33, 42, 50, 57, 75 and 100 city problems.},

Each customer must be supplied exactly once by one vehicle route. The total demand of any vehicle must not exceed the vehicle capacity. The total length of any route must not exceed a pre-specified bound. Approximate methods based on descent, hybrid simulated annealing/tabu search, and tabu search algorithms are developed and different search strategies are investigated. A special data structure for the tabu search algorithm is implemented which has reduced notably the computational time by more than 50\%. An estimate for the tabu list size is statistically derived. Computational results are reported on a sample of seventeen bench-mark test problems from the literature and nine randomly generated problems. The new methods improve significantly both the number of vehicles used and the total distances travelled on all results reported in the literature.},

As with many existing algorithms, a traditional genetic algorithm will have limited success with this problem class, particularly as the problem size increases. A rule based genetic algorithm is proposed and demonstrated on sets of traveling salesman problems of increasing size. The solution character as well as the solution efficiency is compared against a simulated annealing technique as well as a standard genetic algorithm. The rule based genetic algorithm is shown to provide superior performance for all problem sizes considered. Furthermore, a post optimal analysis provides insight into which rules were successfully applied during the solution process which allows for rule modification to further enhance performance.},

It is shown that this function is convex for low temperatures and concave for high temperatures. We also provide a lower bound for the number of plateaux of a simulated annealing based on a geometric cooling schedule. Finally, many numerical experiments are reported.},

Parameters’ setting is a key factor for its performance, but it is also a tedious work. To simplify parameters setting, we present a list-based simulated annealing (LBSA) algorithm to solve traveling salesman problem (TSP). LBSA algorithm uses a novel list-based cooling schedule to control the decrease of temperature. Specifically, a list of temperatures is created first, and then the maximum temperature in list is used by Metropolis acceptance criterion to decide whether to accept a candidate solution. The temperature list is adapted iteratively according to the topology of the solution space of the problem. The effectiveness and the parameter sensitivity of the list-based cooling schedule are illustrated through benchmark TSP problems. The LBSA algorithm, whose performance is robust on a wide range of parameter values, shows competitive performance compared with some other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

	abstract = {The Swiss system is the most popular chess tournament system that is recognised and regulated by the World Chess Federation (FIDE). Chess pairings in each round of a Swiss tournament are conducted by sophisticated matching algorithms. The matching mechanisms are precisely deﬁned in the FIDE guidebook [3], currently four diﬀerent variants are allowed. The descriptions of the matching procedures are such that every arbiter should be able to conduct the pairings, even without computer assistance. However, many parts of these procedures are very ineﬃcient, as they may terminate in highly exponential time in the number of players due to their exhaustive search nature. We demonstrate how the main priority rules of the Dutch variant can be replaced by eﬃcient matching algorithms. These eﬃcient algorithms can serve as the base of software tools used for pairings.},

	abstract = {Since the early part of this century, estimates for Weyl sums (or generalisations thereof) have been central to the treatment of many problems in the additive theory of numbers. For over forty years, the strongest such estimates have stemmed from a method due to Vinogradov [8], the argument having been somewhat simplified recently by the use of the large sieve (see [4, Lemma 5.4]). During this period, improvements in estimates for generalisations of Weyl sums have arisen from improved bounds on mean values of such sums, very recently with the arrival of Vaughan's new iterative method (see [5, Theorems 1.5 and 1.8]). In contrast, this paper will be devoted to improvements at the core of this circle of ideas, within Vinogradov's method itself. Our ideas, which here we shall investigate in the context of smooth Weyl sums, would seem to be applicable elsewhere, and this is a matter which we intend to pursue in the future. We now describe our conclusions in some detail. Let k be a natural number, and P be a large real number. When 2 {\textless} R {\textless} P, we define the set of /{\textasciicircum}-smooth numbers, s\#(P, R), by},

	abstract = {The availability of medical imaging data from clinical archives, research literature, and clinical manuals, coupled with recent advances in computer vision offer the opportunity for image-based diagnosis, teaching, and biomedical research. However, the content and semantics of an image can vary depending on its modality and as such the identification of image modality is an important preliminary step. The key challenge for automatically classifying the modality of a medical image is due to the visual characteristics of different modalities: some are visually distinct while others may have only subtle differences. This challenge is compounded by variations in the appearance of images based on the diseases depicted and a lack of sufficient training data for some modalities. In this paper, we introduce a new method for classifying medical images that uses an ensemble of different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. CNNs are a state-of-the-art image classification technique that learns the optimal image features for a given classification task. We hypothesise that different CNN architectures learn different levels of semantic image representation and thus an ensemble of CNNs will enable higher quality features to be extracted. Our method develops a new feature extractor by fine-tuning CNNs that have been initialized on a large dataset of natural images. The fine-tuning process leverages the generic image features from natural images that are fundamental for all images and optimizes them for the variety of medical imaging modalities. These features are used to train numerous multiclass classifiers whose posterior probabilities are fused to predict the modalities of unseen images. Our experiments on the ImageCLEF 2016 medical image public dataset (30 modalities; 6776 training images, and 4166 test images) show that our ensemble of fine-tuned CNNs achieves a higher accuracy than established CNNs. Our ensemble also achieves a higher accuracy than methods in the literature evaluated on the same benchmark dataset and is only overtaken by those methods that source additional training data.},

The CNN features obtained from multiple spectral bands are fused at the initial layers of deep neural networks as opposed to final layers. The early fusion architecture has fewer parameters and thereby reduces the computational time and GPU memory during training and inference. We also propose a composite fusion architecture that fuses features throughout the network. The methods were validated on four different datasets: ISPRS Potsdam, Vaihingen, IEEE Zeebruges and Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 dataset. For the Sentinel-1,-2 datasets, we obtain the ground truth labels for three classes from OpenStreetMap. Results on all the images show early fusion, specifically after layer three of the network, achieves results similar to or better than a decision level fusion mechanism. The performance of the proposed architecture is also on par with the state-of-the-art results.},

Second, this survey provides the overview of studies in main application areas of U-shaped networks, including brain tumor, stroke, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), eye, cardiac, liver, musculoskeletal, skin cancer, and neuronal pathology.

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build "fully convolutional" networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a novel architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20\% relative improvement to 62.2\% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes one third of a second for a typical image.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00561},
	abstract = {We present a novel and practical deep fully convolutional neural network architecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation termed SegNet. This core trainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding decoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture of the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional layers in the VGG16 network. The role of the decoder network is to map the low resolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for pixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which the decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically, the decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the corresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the need for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then convolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps. We compare our proposed architecture with the widely adopted FCN and also with the well known DeepLab-LargeFOV, DeconvNet architectures. This comparison reveals the memory versus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance. SegNet was primarily motivated by scene understanding applications. Hence, it is designed to be efficient both in terms of memory and computational time during inference. It is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable parameters than other competing architectures. We also performed a controlled benchmark of SegNet and other architectures on both road scenes and SUN RGB-D indoor scene segmentation tasks. We show that SegNet provides good performance with competitive inference time and more efficient inference memory-wise as compared to other architectures. We also provide a Caffe implementation of SegNet and a web demo at http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

Later researchers and composers discovered the cognitive and aesthetic side effects of this new concept. Experimental psychologist Carl Stumpf found that stable tones veil their source; their recognition strongly depends on their characteristic beginnings and endings. Arnold Schoenberg in turn used this effect to merge the sounds of musical instruments into new orchestral colors. On the basis of a three-part case study, I argue that nineteenth-century research in perception has deeply affected twentieth-century concepts of music, bringing to the fore the aesthetic quality of experimental situations.},

Speakers can, and typically do, tune their performance according to communicative and situational demands, controlling the interplay between production-oriented factors on the one hand, and output-oriented constraints on the other. For the ideal speaker, H\&H claims that such adaptations reflect his tacit awareness of the listener’s access to sources of information independent of the signal and his judgement of the short-term demands for explicit signal information. Hence speakers are expected to vary their output along a continuum of hyper- and hypospeech. The theory suggests that the lack of invariance that speech signals commonly exhibit (Perkell and Klatt 1986) is a direct consequence of this adaptive organization (cf MacNeilage 1970). Accordingly, in the H\&H program the quest for phonetic invariance is replaced by another research task: Explicating the notion of sufficient discriminability and defining the class of speech signals that meet that criterion.},

Affective disorders such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are known to influence motor control and in particular speech production. The assessment and documentation of reduced vowel space and reduced expressivity often either rely on subjective assessments or on analysis of speech under constrained laboratory conditions (e.g. sustained vowel production, reading tasks). These constraints render the analysis of such measures expensive and impractical. Within this work, we investigate an automatic unsupervised machine learning based approach to assess a speaker’s vowel space. Our experiments are based on recordings of 253 individuals. Symptoms of depression and PTSD are assessed using standard self-assessment questionnaires and their cut-off scores. The experiments show a significantly reduced vowel space in subjects that scored positively on the questionnaires. We show the measure’s statistical robustness against varying demographics of individuals and articulation rate. The reduced vowel space for subjects with symptoms of depression can be explained by the common condition of psychomotor retardation influencing articulation and motor control. These findings could potentially support treatment of affective disorders, like depression and PTSD in the future.},

Voice changing has many applications in the industry and commercial filed. This paper emphasizes voice conversion using a pitch shifting method which depends on detecting the pitch of the signal (fundamental frequency) using Simplified Inverse Filter Tracking (SIFT) and changing it according to the target pitch period using time stretching with Pitch Synchronous Over Lap Add Algorithm (PSOLA), then resampling the signal in order to have the same play rate. The same study was performed to see the effect of voice conversion when some Arabic speech signal is considered. Treatment of certain Arabic voiced vowels and the conversion between male and female speech has shown some expansion or compression in the resulting speech. Comparison in terms of pitch shifting is presented here. Analysis was performed for a single frame and a full segmentation of speech.},

For both tasks, acoustic features from multiple domains and traditional machine learning methods are used. The discrimination power of existing and proposed features is assessed through mutual information. Multiple supervised and unsupervised approaches are compared. A significant relative reduction of voicing errors over the best baseline is obtained: 20\% with the best clustering method (K-means) and 45\% with a Multi-Layer Perceptron. For F0 contour estimation, the benefits of regression techniques are limited though. We investigate whether those objective gains translate in a parametric synthesis task. Clear perceptual preferences are observed for the proposed approach over two widely-used baselines (RAPT and DIO).},

We acknowledge the fact that obtaining ground truth annotations at the required temporal and frequency resolution is a particularly daunting task. Therefore, we propose to adopt a self-supervised learning technique, which is able to estimate pitch without any form of supervision. The key observation is that pitch shift maps to a simple translation when the audio signal is analysed through the lens of the constant-Q transform (CQT). We design a self-supervised task by feeding two shifted slices of the CQT to the same convolutional encoder, and require that the difference in the outputs is proportional to the corresponding difference in pitch. In addition, we introduce a small model head on top of the encoder, which is able to determine the confidence of the pitch estimate, so as to distinguish between voiced and unvoiced audio. Our results show that the proposed method is able to estimate pitch at a level of accuracy comparable to fully supervised models, both on clean and noisy audio samples, although it does not require access to large labeled datasets.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a polyphonic pitch tracking system able to extract both framewise and note-based estimates from audio. The system uses several artificial neural networks in a deep layered learning setup. First, cascading networks are applied to a spectrogram for framewise fundamental frequency (f0) estimation. A sparse receptive field is learned by the first network and then used as a filter kernel for parameter sharing throughout the system. The f0 activations are connected across time to extract pitch contours. These contours define a framework within which subsequent networks perform onset and offset detection, operating across both time and smaller pitch fluctuations at the same time. As input, the networks use, e.g., variations of latent representations from the f0 estimation network. Finally, incorrect tentative notes are removed one by one in an iterative procedure that allows a network to classify notes within an accurate context. The system was evaluated on four public test sets: MAPS, Bach10, TRIOS, and the MIREX Woodwind quintet, and performed state-of-the-art results for all four datasets. It performs well across all subtasks: f0, pitched onset, and pitched offset tracking.},

The algorithm to estimate the pitch period uses center clipping, infinite peak clipping, and a simplified autocorrelation analysis. The analysis is performed on a 300 sample section of speech which is both center clipped and infinite peak clipped, yielding a threelevel speech signal where the levels are —1, 0, and +1 depending on the relation of the original speech sample to the clipping threshold. Thus computation of the autocorrelation function of the clipped speech is easily implemented in digital hardware using simple combinatorial logic, i.e., an up-down counter can be used to compute each correlation point.

	abstract = {A comparative performance study of seven pitch detection algorithms was conducted. A speech data base, consisting of eight utterances spoken by three males, three females, and one child was constructed. Telephone, close talking microphone, and wideband recordings were made of each of the utterances. For each of the utterances in the data base; a "standard" pitch contour was semiautomatically measured using a highly sophisticated interactive pitch detection program. The "standard" pitch contour was then compared with the pitch contour that was obtained from each of the seven programmed pitch detectors. The algorithms used in this study were 1) a center clipping, infinite-peak clipping, modified autocorrelation method (AUTOC), 2) the cepstral method (CEP), 3) the simplified inverse filtering technique (SIFT) method, 4) the parallel processing time-domain method (PPROC), 5) the data reduction method (DARD), 6) a spectral flattening linear predictive coding (LPC) method, and 7) the average magnitude difference function (AMDF) method. A set of measurements was made on the pitch contours to quantify the various types of errors which occur in each of the above methods. Included among the error measurements were the average and standard deviation of the error in pitch period during voiced regions, the number of gross errors in the pitch period, and the average number of voiced-unvoiced classification errors. For each of the error measurements, the individual pitch detectors could be rank ordered as a measure of their relative performance as a function of recording condition, and pitch range of the various speakers. Performance scores are presented for each of the seven pitch detectors based on each of the categories of error.},

In digital music production, TSM has become an indispensable tool, which is nowadays integrated in a wide range of music production software. Music signals are diverse—they comprise harmonic, percussive, and transient components, among others. Because of this wide range of acoustic and musical characteristics, there is no single TSM method that can cope with all kinds of audio signals equally well. Our main objective is to foster a better understanding of the capabilities and limitations of TSM procedures. To this end, we review fundamental TSM methods, discuss typical challenges, and indicate potential solutions that combine different strategies. In particular, we discuss a fusion approach that involves recent techniques for harmonic-percussive separation along with time-domain and frequency-domain TSM procedures.},

Amongst the different techniques that can be used to get IAS signal, Elapse Time seems to bring the best results and is under consideration in this paper. However, since the lack of advance processing tool limits the development of this technology, this paper proposes an alternative technique to extract dry impacts components from IAS spectrum and therefore, greatly enhance its capacity to detect bearing fault. The efﬁciency of the proposed technique is shown on real measurements issued from a wind turbine main bearing fault, and compared to classical IAS analysis tools.},

We extend trainable infinite impulse response (IIR) filters to the hyperconditioned case, in which a transformation is learned to directly map external parameters of the distortion effect to its internal filter and gain parameters, along with activations necessary to ensure filter stability. We propose a novel, efficient training scheme of IIR filters by means of a Fourier transform. Our models have significantly fewer parameters and reduced complexity relative to more traditional black-box neural audio effect modeling methodologies using finite impulse response filters. Our smallest, best-performing model adequately models a BOSS MT-2 pedal at 44.1 kHz, using a total of 40 biquads and only 210 parameters. Its model parameters are interpretable, can be related back to the original analog audio circuit, and can even be intuitively altered by machine learning non-specialists after model training. Quantitative and qualitative results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In contrast to time-domain time-scaling and pitch-shifting techniques, the phase vocoder is generally considered to yield high quality results, especially for large modification factors and/or polyphonic signals. However, the phase vocoder is also known for introducing a characteristic perceptual artifact, often described as "phasiness", "reverberation", or "loss of presence". This paper examines the problem of phasiness in the context of time-scale modification and provides new insights into its causes. Two extensions to the standard phase vocoder algorithm are introduced, and the resulting sound quality is shown to be significantly improved. Moreover, the modified phase vocoder is shown to provide a factor-of-two decrease in computational cost.},

However, the phase-vocoder is also known for an artifact that plagues its output, and has been described in the literature as either ”phasiness”, ”reverberation”, or ”loss of presence”. Recent research has been devoted to understanding and reducing this artifact, and solutions have been proposed which either signiﬁcantly improve the quality of the output at the cost of a very high additional computation time, or are inexpensive but only marginally eﬀective. This paper examines the problem of phasiness in the context of time-scale modiﬁcation of signals, and presents two new phase synchronization schemes which are shown to both signiﬁcantly improve the sound quality, and reduce the computational cost of such modiﬁcations.},

	abstract = {In this paper we propose a new method to reduce phase vocoder artifacts during attack transients. In contrast to all transient preservation algorithms that have been proposed up to now the new approach does not impose any constraints on the time dilation parameter for processing transient segments. By means of an investigation into the spectral properties of attack transients of simple sinusoids we provide new insights into the causes of phase vocoder artifacts and propose a new method for transient preservation as well as a new criterion and a new algorithm for transient detection. Both, the transient detection and the transient processing algorithms are designed to operate on the level of spectral bins which reduces possible artifacts in stationary signal components that are close to the spectral peaks classiﬁed as transient. The transient detection criterion has a close relation to the transient position and allows us to ﬁnd an optimal position for reinitializing the phase spectrum. The evaluation of the transient detector by means of a hand labeled data base demonstrates its superior performance compared to a previously published algorithm. Attack transients in sound signals transformed with the new algorithm achieves high quality even if strong dilation is applied to polyphonic signals.},

Some of the notable uses of pitch shifters are in cartoons and entertainment industry for producing very distinct and unique voice, electronic music to generate melodies, metallic music to generate unnatural sound effects, and so on. However, one of the major problems of the pitch shifting algorithms is that there is not a sole algorithm, which can deal efficiently with all types of music and sounds. Here, we are evaluating the performance of three different pitch-shifting algorithms: pitch shifting via phase vocoder using phase locking, PitchshiftOcean, and pitch shifting via TSM using WSOLA for five musical instruments including guitar, piano, violin, drum, and flute.

Though there exist a number of highly-accurate methods, both mono-pitch estimation and multi-pitch estimation (particularly with unspecified polyphonic timbre) prove computationally and conceptually challenging. A number of current techniques, whilst incredibly effective, are not targeted towards eliciting the underlying mathematical structures that underpin the complex musical patterns exhibited by acoustic musical signals. Tackling the approach from both a theoretical and experimental perspective, we present a novel framework, a basis for further work in the area, and results that (whilst not state of the art) demonstrate relative efficacy. The framework presented in this paper opens up a completely new way to tackle PE problems, and may have uses both in traditional analytical approaches, as well as in the emerging machine learning (ML) methods that currently dominate the literature.},

	abstract = {The phase-vocoder is usually presented as a high-quality solution for time-scale modiﬁcation of signals, pitch-scale modiﬁcations usually being implemented as a combination of timescaling and sampling rate conversion [1]. In this paper, we present two new phase-vocoder-based techniques which allow direct manipulation of the signal in the frequency-domain, enabling such applications as pitch-shifting, chorusing, harmonizing, partial stretching and other exotic modiﬁcations which cannot be achieved by the standard time-scale samplingrate conversion scheme. The new techniques are based on a very simple peak-detection stage, followed by a peak-shifting stage. The very simplest one allows for 50\% overlap but restricts the precision of the modiﬁcations, while the most ﬂexible techniques requires a more expensive 75\% overlap.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for fundamental frequency detection on polyphonic acoustic musical signals, based on a new ‘raking’ method over the frequency-domain spectra. The algorithm is evaluated as a classiﬁer, and boasts a good accuracy (83.20\%) compared to other such methods, as well as the ability to function effectively in real-time, with a runningspeed below 140ms per window evaluated. This proves to be real-time for the use-case, as the latency between an auditory stimulus and its perception by a person has been shown to be longer than this. The algorithm itself runs in linear-time, but is thus slowed by the O(nlog(n)) Fast Fourier Transform during preprocessing. Though the algorithm fails to account for certain edge-cases with overlapping harmonics as well as certain instruments, future work and improvements are also presented, paving the way for further research.},
