LAB PRESENTATION 2/5/23 - AUDIO DIFFUSION

1. Title

2. Audio diffusion in the news:
    a. Drake song
    b. Joe Biden clips


3. Outline of the presentation (i.e. what papers we'll be looking at)
    a. Music generation (via MIDI -> Spectrograms -> waveforms)
        MULTI-INSTRUMENT MUSIC SYNTHESIS WITH SPECTROGRAM DIFFUSION 
        https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.05408.pdf

    b. Voice generation (or just general raw audio/waves)
        i. DiffWave https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09761.pdf
        ii. WaveGrad https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.00713.pdf


    JUST DO DIFFWAVE

4. Other Neural Vocoders
    Very old Vocoders (NY World Fair 1940)

    Autoregressive techniques (generating next sample based on previous sample) (e.g. Deepmind's WaveNet: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499.pdf)
        Generally very slow

    GANs used to be popular (and SotA) (e.g. WaveGAN: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04208.pdf)

    Now diffusion methods are proving to work well and allow for quick sampling (in part bc they're not autoregressive)
    E.g. WaveGrad (Google) & DiffWave (NVIDIA & Baidu)

5. DiffWave diffusion overviwew

6. Training on ELBO

7. Full architecture (w/ convolutions &c.)

8. Performance
    Explain the metrics







Explain evaluation metrics:
    Frechet distance
    &c.
