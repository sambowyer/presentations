- Recap of Diffsion models
- MDMs specifically (maybe touch on MD4, D3PM? or just LLaDA)
- SAMPLING/DECODING:
    - LLaDA
    - Top-prob
    - Top prob margin
    - Gumbel top-prob
    - confidence aware
    - entropy bound
    - PC sampling
    - Hyperscheduling? (maybe ignore tbh)
    - ... SiMDM
- SiMDM:
    - train a model q to tell us which tokens to sample next
    - use VI 
    - try to figure out link between entropy bound approach and SiMDM
